# ThatValidator
Powerful and extensible javascript form validation that doesn't suck. 

## About
Form validation isn't hard to hack together, but for complicated forms it can quickly become a mess. There's a definite benefit to keeping your event listeners organized and managing all the focus, blur, keypress, and keyup events.

Visit http://jondum.github.io/ThatValidator for a pretty thing to look at it.


##  Installation

Include ThatValidator on your page however you like.

```javascript
<script src='js/ThatValidator.min.js'></script>
```

```javascript
require('/ThatValidator.js', function(ThatValidator){
   //do stuff
));
```



## Usage


### Basics

##### Creating a validator instance

The end goal is for your form code to be contained in a single configuration object per form. However, since the config is just an object, you can reuse the config across forms or have inheritance by extending a base config.

`var myValidator = new ThatValidator('#myForm', config);`

Note: the first parameter does not have to be a `<form>` element. It can be any container element.


##### Configuring

If `config` was inlined, it might look like

```javascript 
var myValidator = new ThatValidator('#myForm', {
   completed: function() { ... }, /* called if form filled and valid */
   fields: { ... }
})	
```


##### Fields


`fields` is where the real magic happens. Each key represents a selector and the value is an object to configure anything that matches that selector (custom validations, DOM event hooks, etc).

```javascript 
var myValidator = new ThatValidator('#myForm', {
   ...
   fields: { 
     'input[type="text"]': { /* config for all text inputs*/ },
     '#email': { /* config for element with id #email */  }
   }
})	
```

For each key in fields, the value can either be an object with additional keys for configuration or a function as a shorthand for defining validations only.

```javascript 
var myValidator = new ThatValidator('#myForm', {
   ...
   fields: { 
     'input[type="text"]': { 
        validations: function(field) { ...  },
        onFocus: function(field, event) { ... },
        onBlur: function(field, event) { ... },
     },
     '#email': function(field) { 
         ...
      }
   }
})	
```

##### Validations Functions

The actual validations happen inside `validations` functions. These functions require you to always return an array of errors (or `undefined` if it is an async validation). Returning an empty array tells ThatValidator that there are no errors and that the field is valid. Otherwise, each string entry in the array is considered an error.


```javascript 
var myValidator = new ThatValidator('#myForm', {
   ...
   fields: { 
     'input[type="text"]': { 
        
        validations: function(field) {  
             var errors = [];
             
             if(field.value.length < 1)
               errors.push(field.name+" is required");
               
             return errors;
        }
     },
     
     '#email': function(field) { 
         //short hand for '#email: {validations: function(field) {}}
         var errors = [];
         if(field.value.indexOf('@') == -1)
             errors.push('Invalid email');
         return errors;
      }
   }
})	
```

This is very powerful because `validations` functions overlap and stack. For example, you could apply a validation on all fields with a `.required` class that just checks for a minimum field length, then do additional validations specific to each field. Errors will stack and you can display the errors to the user in whatever way you like.

###### Asynchronous Validations

ThatValidator also supports asynchronous validations, e.g., you need to check if a username is taken. Do your Async stuff, then call `callback` and pass `callback` an array of errors like normal

```javascript 
var myValidator = new ThatValidator('#myForm', {
   ...
   fields: { 
      ...
     '#username': function(field, callback) { 
         //ajax function
         checkUsernameIsTaken(field.value).then(function(taken)
            var errors = [];
            if(taken)
               errors.push('Username is already taken!');
            callback(errors);
         );
      }
   }
})	
```

**Important:** ThatValidator assumes a field has an async callback when it returns nothing. This is why it is important to always return an array for non-asynchronous fields.

##### Handlers

You can supply additional functions to each fields key to run on various events. Supported events are `onError`, `onValid`, `onFocus`, `onBlur`, `onKeyUp`, `onKeyPress`. Like validation functions, these events overlap with other entries in `fields`. Meaning you can define a global handler for all inputs so you do not need to repeat code and then have an additonal, more specific handler where needed. 

```javascript 
var myValidator = new ThatValidator('#myForm', {
   ...
   fields: { 
     'input[type="text"]': { 
        
        validations: function(field) {  
             ...
        },
        
        // will be called for *any* text input when it
        // does not pass validations!
        onError: function(field, errors) { .. },
        
        // same, except for when it is valid
        onValid: function(field) { â€¦ },
     },
     
     '#phone': {
        onKeyPress: function(field, event)
        {
             preventDefaultOnNonDigit(event);
        }
     }
})	
```


### API


**`.validate(callback, runHandlers /* optional */, field /* optional */)`**

Go through the form and validate each field. Calls callback when it is finished. 

```javascript
validator.validate(function(isValid) {
  if(isValid)
      console.log('yay form is valid!');
  else
      console.log('oh noes!');
});
```

`runHandlers` (default `false`) will also run event hooks while going through validations (if you wanted your form to be visually updated).

`field` (default `undefined`) if you only want `.validate()` to work on a single field instead of the whole form. Array of fields not supported at this time.


**`.isValid(field /* optional */)`**

Returns a Boolean of the *immediate* state of the form or a single field without running any validations. If you want to revalidate the form and then check if it is valid, it is better to use `.validate()`




## Contributing

contributing to improved design or adding features. Some guidelines below:

* **Questions**: Please post to Stack Overflow and tag with `ThatValidator` : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ThatValidator.

* **New Features**: If you'd like to work on a feature, start by creating a 'Feature Design: Title' issue. This will let people bat it around a bit before you send a full blown pull request. Also, you can create an issue to discuss a design even if you won't be working on it. Any collaboration is good! But please be patient. :)

* **Bugs**: If you find a bug and it's non-obvious what's causing it (almost
  always) please provide a reproduction CodePen and give some context
  around the bug. Pasting in a snippet of JavaScript probably won't be enough.

* **Answer Questions!**: If you can help another user please do!
